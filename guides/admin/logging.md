description: Learn how to set up logging for your Coder deployment.

Logging can help you understand what's happening under the hood of your Coder
deployment and is useful for debugging and monitoring the health of your
cluster.

## Accessing logs

You can access your logs at any time by running:

```console
kubectl -n coder logs <podname>
```

## Exporting logs

The following sections show how you can change your Helm chart values to export
logs.

> See our guide to [updating your Helm chart](helm-charts.md) if you're
> unfamiliar with updating a Helm chart.

Please note that:

- Setting either the `/dev/stdout` or `/dev/stderr` value to an empty string to
  disable.

- You can use `/dev/stdout` and `/dev/stderr` interchangeably, since both write
  to the pod's standard output and error directories.

- Coder supports writing logs to multiple output targets.

## Human-readable logs

This is the default value that's set in the Helm chart:

```yaml
logging:
  human: /dev/stderr
```

When set, logs will be sent to the `/dev/stderr` file path and formatted for
human readability.

## JSON-formatted logs

You can get JSON-formatted logs by setting the `json` value:

```yaml
logging:
  json: /dev/stderr
```

## Sending logs to Google Stackdriver

If you deployed your Kubernetes cluster to Google Cloud, you can send logs to
Stackdriver:

```yaml
logging:
  stackdriver: /dev/stderr
```

## Sending logs to Splunk

Coder can send logs directly to Splunk. Splunk uses the HTTP Event Collector
(HEC) to receive data and application logs. See Splunk's docs for
[information on configuring an HEC](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.3/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector).

Once you've configured an HEC, you'll need to update your Helm chart with your
HTTP (HEC) endpoint and your HEC collector token.

To provide your HTTP (HEC) endpoint:

```yaml
logging:
  splunk:
    url: ""
```

To provide your HEC collector token:

```yaml
logging:
  splunk:
    token: ""
```

Optionally, you can
[specify the Splunk channel](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.3/Data/AboutHECIDXAck#About_channels_and_sending_data)
that you'd like associated with your messages. Channels allow logs to be
segmented by client, preventing Coder application logs from affecting other
client logs in your Splunk deployment.

```yaml
logging:
  splunk:
    channel: ""
```
